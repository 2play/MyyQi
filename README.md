This is a working patched 4.9 kernel with [Mali r15p0 Kernel drivers](http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/open-source-mali-midgard-gpu-kernel-drivers/), using the torvalds branch as a basis.

Currently this kernel has been tested sucessfully with the [Firefly's Mali User-space r12p0 drivers for fbdev and wayland](http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/arm-mali-midgard-gpu-user-space-drivers/#mali-user-space-driver-r12p0-mali-t760-gnulinux), using the [OpenGL ES 3.1 samples of the Mali OpenGL ES SDK](http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/sdks/opengl-es-sdk-for-linux/).

X11 drivers were not tested successfully however.

**Note**: The compilation process of 4.9 kernels currently do NOT finish with Binutils GOLD. You'll need Binutils BFD (aka `ld.bfd`) to compile 4.9 kernels for ARM systems. Keeping GOLD as the main linker while toying with the CFLAGS to use `ld.bfd` won't resolve the issue.

The kernel was compiled using the following procedure :
```bash
# Get the kernel
export KERNEL_VERSION=v4.9
git clone --depth 1 --branch $KERNEL_VERSION 'git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git' &&
cd linux

# Download, prepare and copy the Mali Kernel-Space drivers. 
# Some TGZ are AWFULLY packaged with everything having 0777 rights.
export MALI_VERSION=r15p0-00rel0
wget "http://malideveloper.arm.com/downloads/drivers/TX011/$MALI_VERSION/TX011-SW-99002-$MALI_VERSION.tgz" &&
tar zxvf TX011-SW-99002-$MALI_VERSION.tgz &&
cd TX011-SW-99002-$MALI_VERSION &&
find . -type 'f' -exec chmod 0644 {} ';' &&
find . -type 'd' -exec chmod 0755 {} ';' &&
find . -name 'sconscript' -exec rm {} ';' &&
rm -r 'driver/product/kernel/patches' 'driver/product/kernel/license.txt' &&
cp -r driver/product/kernel/drivers/gpu/arm ../drivers/gpu/ &&
cp -r driver/product/kernel/drivers/base/ump ../drivers/base/ &&
cd .. &&
rm -r TX011-SW-99002-$MALI_VERSION TX011-SW-99002-$MALI_VERSION.tgz

# Get the configuration file and compile the kernel
export ARCH=arm
#export CROSS_COMPILE=armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi-
make mrproper
wget -O .config 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Miouyouyou/MyyQi/master/boot/config-4.9.0MyyMyy%2B'
make rk3288-miqi.dtb zImage modules -j5
```

This procedure was stored in the **[GetPatchAndCompileKernel.sh](./GetPatchAndCompileKernel.sh)** file and can be run like this :
```bash
sh GetPatchAndCompileKernel.sh
```

You will need compiling tools, **git**, **wget** and **find** in order to execute this procedure successfully.

The patches applied are stored in the **[patches/](./patches/)** folder.

To install this kernel, copy the **zImage** and the **rk3288-miqi.dtb** file in your boot partition.
Note that if you have access to U-boot through a serial console AND your MiQi is powered through your USB computer, you can access the whole eMMC like a USB memory stick using the following command :
```
ums 0 mmc 1
```

TODO
----

- [x] Document how to use the generated kernel and boot it
- [x] Add the [Open Source Kernel-space Mali Midgard drivers](http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/open-source-mali-midgard-gpu-kernel-drivers/)
- [ ] Add [gator](https://github.com/ARM-software/gator)
- [ ] Document how to use [DS-5 : Streamline](https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/ds-5-development-studio/streamline/overview) to analyse OpenGL ES 2.x/3.x programs running on MiQi boards using such kernels.
