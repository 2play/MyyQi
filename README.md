About
-----

This is a working patched 4.9 kernel with [Mali r15p0 Kernel drivers](http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/open-source-mali-midgard-gpu-kernel-drivers/), using the torvalds branch as a basis.
This also integrate patches from Willy Tarreau, allowing to get better performances from the board. More informations [in this thread](https://forum.mqmaker.com/t/miqi-based-build-farm-finally-up-and-running/605).

Note that it does not integrate some potentially dangerous patches.

Currently this kernel has been tested sucessfully with the [Firefly's Mali User-space r12p0 drivers for fbdev and wayland](http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/arm-mali-midgard-gpu-user-space-drivers/#mali-user-space-driver-r12p0-mali-t760-gnulinux), using the [OpenGL ES 3.1 samples of the Mali OpenGL ES SDK](http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/sdks/opengl-es-sdk-for-linux/). 
Pure DRM OpenGL was also tested successfully with these drivers, using [this patched gl2mark](https://github.com/Miouyouyou/glmark2).

X11 drivers were not tested successfully however.

**Note**: The compilation process of 4.9 kernels currently do NOT finish with Binutils GOLD. You'll need Binutils BFD (aka `ld.bfd`) to compile 4.9 kernels for ARM systems. Keeping GOLD as the main linker while toying with the CFLAGS to use `ld.bfd` won't resolve the issue.

The kernel was compiled using the following procedure :
```bash
function download_and_apply_patches {
	base_url=$1
	patches=${@:2}
	for patch in $patches; do
		wget $base_url/$patch || 
		{ echo "Could not download $patch"; exit 1; }
	done
	git apply $patches
	rm $patches
}

```

This procedure was stored in the **[GetPatchAndCompileKernel.sh](./GetPatchAndCompileKernel.sh)** file and can be run like this :
```bash
sh GetPatchAndCompileKernel.sh
```

You will need compiling tools, **git**, **wget** and **find** in order to execute this procedure successfully.

The patches applied are stored in the **[patches/](./patches/)** folder.

To install this kernel, copy the **zImage** and the **rk3288-miqi.dtb** file in your boot partition.
Note that if you have access to U-boot through a serial console AND your MiQi is powered through your USB computer, you can access the whole eMMC like a USB memory stick using the following command :
```
ums 0 mmc 1
```

TODO
----

- [x] Document how to use the generated kernel and boot it
- [x] Add the [Open Source Kernel-space Mali Midgard drivers](http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/open-source-mali-midgard-gpu-kernel-drivers/)
- [ ] Add [gator](https://github.com/ARM-software/gator)
- [ ] Document how to use [DS-5 : Streamline](https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/ds-5-development-studio/streamline/overview) to analyse OpenGL ES 2.x/3.x programs running on MiQi boards using such kernels.
