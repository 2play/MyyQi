This is a working patched 4.9-rc4 kernel, using the torvalds branch as a basis.

The patches applied are stored in the patch folder.

To install this kernel, copy the zImage and the rk3288-miqi.dtb file in your boot partition.
Note that if you have access to U-boot through a serial console AND your MiQi is powered through your USB computer, you can access the whole eMMC like a USB memory stick using the following command :
```
ums 0 mmc 1
```

Will document the compiling process in a few days...
